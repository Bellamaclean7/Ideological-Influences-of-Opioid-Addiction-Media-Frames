# Analysis of Ideological Influences of Opioid Addiction Media Frames

## Overview

This repo features a reproduction of Tanika Raychaudhuri, Tali Mendelberg, and Anne McDonough's paper, [**`The Political Effects of Opioid Addiction Frames`**](https://doi.org/10.1086/720326), containing data, `R` scripts, and a final `PDF` report ([link here](https://github.com/Bellamaclean7/Ideological-Influences-of-Opioid-Addiction-Media-Frames/blob/main/paper/paper.pdf)). This analysis furthered the original paper's original research question: "Is sympathy for drug users racially selective among White Americans?" by extending the inquiry to examining the role of political ideology in shaping White Americans' reactions to sympathetic media portrayals of opioid abuse.

A replication using the Social Science Reproduction Platform was also produced: https://www.socialsciencereproduction.org/reproductions/1752/index?step=0

## Statement on LLM usage

None of the code code produced in this paper was written with the help of the ChatGPT. Some aspects of the written analysis were enhanced with the help of ChatGPT. This included running the paper through ChatGPT to catch speeling errors, grammar errors, etc. Most importantly, ChatGPT aided in finding me relevant literature to this paper. The entire chat history is available in [other/llms/usage.txt](https://github.com/Bellamaclean7/Ideological-Influences-of-Opioid-Addiction-Media-Frames/tree/main/other/llm).
