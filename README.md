# Analysis of Ideological Influences of Opioid Addiction Media Frames

## Overview

This repo features a reproduction of Tanika Raychaudhuri, Tali Mendelberg, and Anne McDonough's paper, [**`The Political Effects of Opioid Addiction Frames`**](https://doi.org/10.1086/720326), containing data, `R` scripts, and a final `PDF` report ([link here](https://github.com/Bellamaclean7/Ideological-Influences-of-Opioid-Addiction-Media-Frames/blob/main/paper/paper.pdf)). This analysis furthered the original paper's original research question: "Is sympathy for drug users racially selective among White Americans?" by extending the inquiry to examining the role of political ideology in shaping White Americans' reactions to sympathetic media portrayals of opioid abuse.


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from [(https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/NVMD6X)].
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code were written with the help of the ChatGPT. The entire chat history is available in [other/llms/usage.txt](https://github.com/Bellamaclean7/Ideological-Influences-of-Opioid-Addiction-Media-Frames/tree/main/other/llm).
